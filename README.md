# whac-a-mole
Vanilla JavaScript game


 The idea of whack-a-mole is simple! The player needs to hit the grid with the mole in as many times as possible until the time runs out. 
 
 I implemented te use of:
 
document.querySelector

textContent

forEach

addEventListener

setInterval

classList.add
